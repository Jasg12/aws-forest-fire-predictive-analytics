# Forest Wildfire Analytics w/ AWS Cloud
Wildfires can cause devastating destruction and cost millions of dollars in damage, especially with increasing human development near wilderness or rural areas. The ability to predict wildfires would be a preemptive measure to prevent and/or manage wildfires. Factors affecting wildfires would be explored and used to gauge the probability of a wildfire occurring. Based on the location and the corresponding land type, a machine learning model will be trained to identify the major contributing factors of the fire.
